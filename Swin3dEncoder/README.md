# Swin as Backbone
This is an adaptation of the original implementation of the Sign Language Transformer from https://github.com/neccam/slt.
Instead of using a CNN as a backbone for the embeddings of Sign Language video frames, the videos are given as direct input. Moreover, the encoder is extended with a Swin3d Transformer.
